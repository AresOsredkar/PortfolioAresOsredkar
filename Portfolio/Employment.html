            As a part of a mandatory internship my first job was a school related one. Being antisocial and afraid of new things I decided
            to try and get an internship at my primary school. There we had a professor who has graduated the highest college program for 
            IT. The internship lasted a month and I can't say I learned much since I mostly fixed computers of issues I've already known
            and taught my ex Teacher some new things aswell.
            <br><br>Since I was low on money I decided to get a summer job after wards, which sadly wasn't the computer type. 2 years in a row
            in the summer I worked in a storage haul underground. Oh and I forgot to mention it was a freezer. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius
            but at least the pay was decent for 2 months of freezing 7 hours a day.
            <br><br>After that came another internship, this time college related where I was choosing between what kind of job I want to try out.
            I decided to try out a hardware company that fixed, built and sold computers. 3 months I built custom ordered computers each with
            different components and different software to be installed.
